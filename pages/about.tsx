          Hi Again, I&apos;m Kevin Collazos.
        </h1>

        <p className={s.aboutContainer__p}>
          I am a frontend developer living in New York ðŸ—½. I am currently
          enjoying the process of working as a freelancer for different people,
          communities and companies around the world.
        </p>
        <p className={s.aboutContainer__p}>
          As a developer, I enjoy being able to create experiences and tools
          that allow people to not only work efficiently, but also carve out a
          place in the digital world. I love the concept of entering and feeling
          that in this digital world each of the ideas that our mind proposes
          can be captured and made a reality.
        </p>
        <p className={s.aboutContainer__p}>
          Outside of development, I love spending time with my family and
          friends doing different types of activities. Also I love doing high
          intensity sports like CrossFit and Swimming and of course as a good
          athlete... I love food, all kinds of food in general but in my
          opinion... Latin food is the best, especially colombian food haha. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´
        </p>
